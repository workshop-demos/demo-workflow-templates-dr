# :rocket: Template repository

Demo repo for using custom workflow templates.

:exclamation: **This is a template repository**
- Please click ***Use this template*** to clone the repo into a different organization that you own, and run the demo from there
  - :exclamation: The repository containing the template definition is [`ps-actions-sandbox/.github`](https://github.com/ps-actions-sandbox/.github). This repo also needs to be cloned into your organization, and needs to be **Public**.
- If you're unable to use a different organization, feel free to use this one. Just make sure to complete the **Cleanup** steps afterwards :house_with_garden:

## Usage

### Use this workflow template

1. Navigate to the starter workflow overview
1. Create a new workflow using the custom workflow template
1. Navigate to the `.github` repository where the template files are located
1. Walk through the workflow-template files

### :house_with_garden: Cleanup
1. If the workflow was created in this repository, perform the following steps:
    - Delete the workflow that was created from the template

:bulb: If the workflow template doesn't show up, it's most likely because the `.github` repository visibility is not **Public**.
